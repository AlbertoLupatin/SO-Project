# Spatial Omics Project
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my final project in the Single Cell and Spatial Omics course at the University of Trento. The analysis focuses on a spatial transcriptomics dataset from the Human Cell Atlas and 10xGenomics, specifically on the human intestinal epithelium.

## Project Summary

Using the *Seurat* R package, I performed spatially-aware analyses on a Visium dataset from a healthy human colon. The goal was to:
	•	Understand the spatial distribution of different intestinal cell types;
	•	Identify tissue microenvironments and functional structures;
	•	Perform gene set enrichment and spatial trajectory inference.
 
Key steps included:
	•	Preprocessing of the Seurat object;
	•	Quality control and filtering of spatial spots;
	•	Unsupervised clustering and visualization;
	•	Marker gene analysis and spatial expression mapping;
	•	GO-based functional enrichment and trajectory analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
	•	Languages: R
	•	Dataset: Visium 10X Genomics human colon dataset from 10xGenomics (tumor sample) and the Human Cell Atlas (control sample) datasets

## Notes
Some analysis steps were exploratory and adjusted iteratively. This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.
